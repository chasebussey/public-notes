Hi, I'm Chase Bussey. I'm a software engineer fascinated by how systems get built and the sociotechnical factors that influence their design and behavior.

This space is an ongoing experiment in note-taking and knowledge-sharing. It's part of my effort to [learn in
public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ), which
means sharing my thoughts, ideas, and mistakes with others. Here, you'll find a collection of my own personal notes and reference materials.

I'm trying to impose as little structure here as possible to see what kind of patterns might emerge just from the links between notes and concepts. As the collection here grows, I'll likely
start putting up some indexes or maps of content. For now, though, navigation will be limited to search and link-chasing.

If you'd like to get in touch, reach out by [email](mailto:chase@chasebussey.com) or check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/chasebussey).
