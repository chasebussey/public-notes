> If you write a piece of code and it seems simple to you, but other people think it is complex, then it is complex.

\- John Ousterhout, *A Philosophy of Software Design*

When you've finished writing a module or bit of functionality, you have likely just finished building for yourself some mental chunks and loaded up a *lot* of context on the changes involved ([[Everything is chunking]]). Your colleagues, who are going to have to both review and likely later modify your new code, are in a substantially better position to tell if your change is overly complex.
