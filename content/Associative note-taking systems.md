An associative note-taking system is characterized primarily by the emergence of structure through linking of notes, rather than structure imposed through hierarchical directories or tags.

Both [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Evergreen notes, per Andy Matuschak | Evergreen notes]] are associative note-taking systems.

See: [[The Zettelkasten system is bottom-up]] and [Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8SU3r8xyZyvwRhyDdJasJ2)
