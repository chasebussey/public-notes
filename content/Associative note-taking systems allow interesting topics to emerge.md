A promised advantage of the Zettelkasten system (and, I think, shared by any other form of [[Associative note-taking systems]]) is that by virtue of being [[The Zettelkasten system is bottom-up | bottom-up]] and allowing structure to emerge primarily by the links between concepts, it allows for interesting topics and questions to be surfaced *to the user*, rather than the traditional top-down method of "trying to come up with an interesting thought or question, and then taking notes on prior literature about it".

This is explicitly called out by Ahrens in *[[How to Take Smart Notes]]* in the section titled "Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch".

Much of the prior art on associative note-taking systems (at least, that I have so far encountered) is centered around non-fiction writing and academic use. I don't see any reason this advantage should be limited specifically to writing, though, as it seems just as likely that notes will cluster around an interesting opportunity for a software product, for instance.
