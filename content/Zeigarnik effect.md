The Zeigarnik effect is the tendency of unfinished tasks (or open loops, as is commonly phrased) to hang around in working- or short-term memory until the task is completed (until we close the loop). This effect is a key observation behind the Getting Things Done system, and is detailed in Sönke Ahrens' *[[How to Take Smart Notes]]*.

This observation captures why having too many tasks in progress can feel so very overwhelming: you only get [[Seven, plus or minus two]] slots for working memory, even having 2 open loops occupying that space puts a meaningful dent in your working memory capacity, and [[Working memory is a performance-limiting factor]].

Fortunately, it seems that having a reliable plan eliminates most/all of the cognitive burden associated with the Zeigarnik effect, hence the utility of GTD and the reason that [[Systems for thinking must be comprehensive and reliable]].
