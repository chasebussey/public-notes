In *Learning Systems Thinking*, Diana Montalion presents the following definition of "systems thinking":

> Systems thinking is a system of foundational thinking practices that, when done together, improve nonlinear thinking skills.

Note that this is a recursive definition--systems thinking is itself a system of practices, and should thus be subject to analysis, modification, and improvement by those same practices (and in so doing, by new practices as well). This is a delightful illustration of the nonlinearity emphasized within the book.
