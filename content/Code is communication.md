It's easy to think of code as _just_ instructions for a machine to execute (and the instructions for the machine are not unimportant). It is harder to remember that the code we produce is also the most direct communication of the system to our fellow engineers. 

This isn't a new observation, and it's why readability and maintainability are such a focus for engineering, but it's still a useful mental frame to adopt when building a system or component.
